Hey everyone, this is a step by step guide to install python2.7 with opencv 3.0 + opencv 3.0 contrib pack for ubuntu.

First of all you need to upgrade any pre-installed packages for ubuntu using

sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get upgrade

Now we need to install developer tools

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git pkg-config

Opencv needs to open various images formats for that we need to have image packages

sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev

GTK library is also needed for displaying the image

sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

To access videos and individual frames

sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev

And to optimize various processes

sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran

Now we will install pip

wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

sudo python get-pip.py

We can create virtual environment for separating each project and to install dependencies separately

sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper

sudo rm -rf ~/.cache/pip

Now we need to update our ~/.bashrc file

#virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper

export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs

source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

This will make sure that the virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper are loaded everytime you login. Now you need to logout and login for changes to take effect and reload the contents.

source ~/.bashrc

Now we create a virtualenvironment say "workspace"

mkvirtualenv workspace

Now we install Python 2.7 and numpy

sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev

pip install numpy

Now we will pull opencv from github

cd ~

git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git

cd opencv

git checkout 3.0.0

Now for the contrib pack like SURF,SIFT detectors

cd ~

git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib.git

cd opencv_contrib

git checkout 3.0.0

Now we make the files

cd ~/opencv

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \ -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \ -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON \ -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \ -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_contrib/modules \ -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..

Finally compile

make -j5

Now after compiling successfully we need to install it

sudo make install

sudo ldconfig

Now we need to link our virtual environment with site packages to be able to use OpenCV within our environment WorkSpace

cd ~/.virtualenvs/workspace/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv2.so cv2.so

This has successfully installed Opencv 3.0 with contrib pack into your system

To check..

workon workspace

python

>>> import cv2

>>> cv2.version

'3.0.0' #Will be printed
